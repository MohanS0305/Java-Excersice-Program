		the maximum (the larger of the two integers), the minimum (smaller of the two integers).
		Test Data
		Input 1st integer: 25
		Input 2nd integer: 5
		Expected Output
		Sum of two integers: 30
		Difference of two integers: 20
		Product of two integers: 125
		Average of two integers: 15.00
		Distance of two integers: 20
		Max integer: 25
		Min integer: 5 */
